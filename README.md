# Sudoku-game
The code uses a brute-force backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle by trying different number placements and backtracking when necessary

# 1. Set up the required environment:
Install Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

# 2. Install the necessary dependencies:
NumPy: The code uses the NumPy library to display the Sudoku grid. If you don't have NumPy installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
      **pip install numpy**

# 3.Create a new Python file:
Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
Create a new file and save it with a .py extension (e.g., sudoku_solver.py).

# 4.Copy and paste the code:
Copy the provided code and paste it into the newly created Python file.


# 5.Run the code:
Save the Python file after pasting the code.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the cd command.
Run the code by executing the following command:
Copy code
          **python sudoku_solver.py**

# 6. Observe the output:
The code will solve the Sudoku puzzle and display the solution(s) in the console.
If there are multiple solutions, the program will prompt you to press Enter to find more solutions.
You can examine the Sudoku grid solution(s) and test the code with different puzzles by modifying the game variable at the beginning of the code.

**Note: The code assumes that there is at least one solution for the given Sudoku puzzle. If you input an unsolvable puzzle or an invalid configuration, the code may enter an infinite loop.**
